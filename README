Very basic Ruby interface to the eFax Developer (http://www.efaxdeveloper.com) service.

Strange class names and their attribute names come from "eFax Developer Universal User Guide for Outbound Processing" document.
You can get it on eFax Developer pages or on Scribd (http://www.scribd.com/doc/5382394/eFax-Developer-Universal-User-Guide-Outbound).

== Usage

First you need to provide your account id and credentials:
  EFax::Request.account_id = <your account id>
  EFax::Request.user       = <your login>
  EFax::Request.password   = <your password>


Sending an HTML page using eFax service is pretty simple:
  response = EFax::OutboundRequest.post(recipient_name, company_name, fax_number, subject, html_content)

The response object has the following attributes:
  response.status_code
  response.doc_id           # unique identifier of your request
  response.error_level
  response.error_message
See EFax::RequestStatus class for details on status codes.


Having ID of your request, you can get its current status:
  response = OutboundRequestStatus.post(doc_id)

The status response has the following attributes:
  response.status_code
  response.message          # "user friendly" status message
See EFax::QueryStatus class for details on status codes.
